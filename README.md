# Hi, I'm Dax 👋

I'm a PhD student at Georgia Tech researching agentic systems, distributed infrastructure, and the performance of large language models. I build tools to make LLM-based agents more efficient, observable, and reliable.

🔍 Interests: Systems for ML • Multi-agent orchestration • Distributed AI agent tracing, communication, and infrastructure

⚙️ Current Projects: Agent runtime benchmarking • LLM correction systems • State tracking infrastructure
